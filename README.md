# Liftoff Competition

Competition management platform for Liftoff FPV Simulator. Remotely control your lobby — change tracks, kick players, run playlists with scheduled rotations, and let pilots vote to skip or extend. Includes a BepInEx game plugin, Node.js backend, live spectator view, and admin dashboard. Turn casual lobbies into league nights.

---

## Overview

Liftoff Competition transforms a standard Liftoff multiplayer session into a structured, managed event. It connects a BepInEx game plugin running inside Liftoff to a server backend, which powers two web interfaces: a **public live view** for spectators and an **admin dashboard** for organisers.

### How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐   WebSocket    ┌──────────────┐   WebSocket    ┌──────────────┐
│  Liftoff Game │◄─────────────►│    Server     │◄─────────────►│  Admin Panel  │
│  (BepInEx     │   /ws/plugin  │  (Node.js +   │   /ws/admin   │  (Browser)    │
│   Plugin)     │               │   Express)    │               │               │
└──────────────┘               │               │               └──────────────┘
                                │   SQLite DB   │
                                │               │   WebSocket    ┌──────────────┐
                                │               │◄─────────────►│  Live View    │
                                └──────────────┘   /ws/live     │  (Browser)    │
                                                                └──────────────┘
```

1. The **BepInEx plugin** captures Photon multiplayer events (races, laps, players, chat) inside Liftoff and sends them to the server over WebSocket.
2. The **server** ingests events into SQLite, manages state, and broadcasts updates to connected web clients.
3. The **admin dashboard** lets organisers control the lobby: change tracks, run playlists, send chat, and manage players.
4. The **live view** gives spectators a real-time window into the current race, track, and player activity.
5. Commands flow back from the server to the plugin to execute lobby changes (track switches, chat messages, kicks) inside the game.

## Features

### Lobby Control
- Change tracks remotely from the admin dashboard
- Kick players when moderation is needed
- Browse and search the available track catalog
- Full command/response protocol between server and game

### Playlists
- Create named playlists with ordered track lists
- Start, stop, pause, and skip through playlists
- Scheduled track rotation with configurable timing
- Ideal for league nights, qualifying sessions, tournaments, and curated race events

### Vote to Skip
- Players type `/next` in game chat to start a skip vote (3-minute timer)
- Additional players type `/next` to add their vote
- Configurable vote threshold — when enough players vote, the track advances automatically

### Vote to Extend
- Players type `/extend` in game chat to start an extend vote (3-minute timer)
- Uses the same vote threshold as `/next`
- When the vote passes, 5 minutes are added to the current track timer before it auto-advances

### Idle Kick

- When the lobby is full (8 players), idle pilots inactive for 5 minutes receive an in-game warning
- After 1 additional minute without activity, they are automatically kicked to free up a slot
- Players can type `/stay` in chat to reset their idle timer (adds 5 more minutes)
- JMT_Bot (the host) is always immune and hidden from the admin player list
- Additional players can be whitelisted via admin API, admin dashboard, or `IDLE_KICK_WHITELIST` env var
- Only active when a playlist is running — free lobbies are unaffected

### Player Commands
- `/info` — shows available player commands
- `/next` — vote to skip the current track
- `/extend` — vote to extend the current track by 5 minutes
- `/stay` — reset your idle timer (prevents auto-kick)

### Live Spectator View
- Real-time race visualization in the browser
- Current track and environment display
- Active player roster
- Live lap activity feed
- Connection status indicator
- Designed for embedding in streams, club pages, or community sites

### Admin Dashboard
- Browser-based control panel for event organisers
- Multi-user authentication — each admin has their own username and password
- Player management with kick controls, per-player idle time display, and whitelist toggle
- Track catalog browsing and selection
- Playlist creation, management, and execution
- Live chat monitoring
- Manual and automated chat messaging
- Race monitoring and session overview

### Chat System
- View in-game chat live in the admin panel
- Send messages directly into the game from the browser
- Automated message templates triggered by events:
  - `track_change` — announce the next track
  - `race_start` — notify players a race has begun
  - `race_end` — congratulate the winner
- Template variables: `{env}`, `{track}`, `{race}`, `{mins}`, `{winner}`, `{time}`
- Schedule warning messages before track rotation

### Race Data
- Automatic race and lap recording to SQLite
- Per-pilot tracking via Steam ID and pilot GUID
- Session history and leaderboard support
- Structured JSONL event logs from the plugin

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Server:** Node.js 23+ (or Docker)
- **Plugin:** .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK, Liftoff with [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) installed

### Server Setup

1. **Clone the repo and configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cd Server
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env`** with your own secrets:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   PLUGIN_API_KEY=your-plugin-key
   ADMIN_TOKEN=your-admin-token
   DB_PATH=./competition.db
   IDLE_KICK_WHITELIST=              # comma-separated nicks immune to idle kick
   ADMIN_USER=                       # initial admin username (first run only)
   ADMIN_PASS=                       # initial admin password (first run only)
   ```

3. **Run with Docker (recommended):**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Or **run locally:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Create an admin user** (choose one method):

   **Option A — via environment variables:** Set `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASS` in `.env` before first start. The user is created automatically if the database has no users yet.

   **Option B — via CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd Server
   node src/cli/createUser.js <username> <password>
   ```

   You can create additional users the same way. The `ADMIN_TOKEN` in `.env` continues to work for API/script access via Bearer header.

5. **Access the interfaces:**
   - Live view: `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Admin panel: `http://localhost:3000/admin.html`

### Plugin Setup

1. Install [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) into your Liftoff game directory.

2. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   cd Pluggins/LiftoffPhotonEventLogger
   dotnet build
   ```
   > By default, the project looks for Liftoff at the standard Steam install path. Set the `LIFTOFF_DIR` environment variable to override.

3. Copy the built DLL into `BepInEx/plugins/` in your Liftoff install folder.

4. Configure the plugin's connection settings (server URL and API key) to match your server's `.env` values.

5. Launch Liftoff and join a multiplayer session — the plugin connects to the server automatically.

### Production Deployment

For production with HTTPS:

1. Set up your domain's DNS to point to your server.
2. Run `init-certs.sh` to provision Let's Encrypt certificates.
3. (Optional) Run `init-htpasswd.sh` to set up Nginx Basic Auth as an extra layer for the admin page.
4. Create admin users via CLI or env vars (see step 4 above).
5. Start with Docker Compose — Nginx handles SSL termination and proxying.

## Running Tests

```bash
cd Server
npm test
```
